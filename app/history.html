          <h2>1920's</h2>
          <p>Based on how women were viewed in this time, boudoir photography was not very popular as you can imagine. There were many people during this time that did not agree with what was "popular" or not and wanted to change things. So this year marks the beginning of boudoir photography.</p>

          <p>During this year, Albert Arthur Allen was the first person to come out of the dark and begin shooting boudoir photography. However, most of the footage shot during this time was destroyed since it was illegal to shoot women nude.</p>

          <p>During this year the target model for boudoir altered a little. Before this year, the main target model was young, blonde, skinny women. After some time, some photographers disagreed with this preference and produced the same style of art on women of all types.</p>

          </div>
          <p>In today's society, boudoir is finally getting the appreciation that it deserves. Instead of being viewed as slightly pornographic, it is being viewed as a style of art. Boudoir photography is being seen as women who, no matter the body type, are beautiful.</p>
